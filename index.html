    <h2>What is SpaceX?</h2>
    <p>Space Exploration Technologies Corp. is an American aerospace manufacturer and space transportation services
      company headquartered in Hawthorne, California. It was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk with the goal of reducing
      space transportation costs to enable the colonization of Mars.
      SpaceX has developed several launch vehicles, as well as the Dragon cargo spacecraft and the Starlink satellite
      constellation (providing internet access), and has flown humans to the International Space Station on the SpaceX
      Dragon 2.</p>

    <h2>SpaceX Dragon v2</h2>
    <p>The SpaceX Dragon 2 is a class of reusable spacecraft developed and manufactured by American aerospace
      manufacturer SpaceX as the successor to Dragon, a reusable cargo spacecraft. It has two variants: Crew Dragon, a
      space capsule capable of ferrying up to seven astronauts, and Cargo Dragon, an updated replacement for the
      original Dragon spacecraft. The spacecraft launches atop a Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket and returns to Earth via an
      ocean splashdown. Unlike its predecessor, the spacecraft can dock itself to the ISS instead of being berthed.</p>

    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>‚ÄúYou want to wake up in the morning and think the future is going to be great - and that‚Äôs what being a
      spacefaring civilization is all about. It‚Äôs about believing in the future and thinking that the future will be
      better than the past. And I can‚Äôt think of anything more exciting than going out there and being among the stars.‚Äù
